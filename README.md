# ScrumSystemForTeams
Created a Agile Scrum system for teams to use to get things done using PHP, Bootstrap 4 and MySQL. (April 2019)

This is a project I wrote when a team I was on wanted to try the Agile Scrum way of doing things. It's poorly written and needs to be refactored in OOP, but still works. You can run this with a simply XAMPP setup or any setup that supports PHP. The SQL file is provided for the Database Structure.
